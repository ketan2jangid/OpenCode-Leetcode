You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.
 

Example 1:

Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]

Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]


Example 2:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = []

Output: []


Example 3:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]

Output: [0]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
