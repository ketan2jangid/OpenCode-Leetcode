Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).
 

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]


Example 2:

Input: root = [1]

Output: [[1]]


Example 3:

Input: root = []

Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
